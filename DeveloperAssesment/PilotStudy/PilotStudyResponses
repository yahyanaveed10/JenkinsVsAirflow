Participant1

Tasks: General Observation Guidelines.  Could change the first sentence to “keep in mind your experience with Jenkis” – unclear

Task 2:
Push and Pull Xcom is unclear. How does push Xcom relate to getting temperature?

What does Task dependency management mean?
Is Data passsing between tasks visualised in the code or UI?
Key Areas to check should be above Observation Points.
Isn’t System response the same as Logs?

Participant 2

Technical terms were pretty clear.

the task sequence progressed from the basic to a higher level which was good and made sense.

The use of libraries which you would need should be mentioned in the prerequisites of the tasks so that the user can install them before hand.

Things were clear just a bit more detailed steps on the tasks.

Additional information about the working of airflow and a little bit background would be helpful. Moreover attaching some links within the document so that the user can go through them on their own would also be helpful.

the questions were clear.
A few questions happened to have the same answer.

the questionnaire flow was very well written and progressed and transitioned slowly from one technology to another and then to their comparison

Participant 3

For Tasks:

- Tasks were a bit complicated, some things like the "push" "pull" in xcoms were unclear.
- The tasks couldve been more detailed.
- Wordings were a bit unambiguous.
- Too many questions.
- Some of the questions had the same answer.
